"""
The event file as the system of record.

Here the data is the subject of the test, not the code. Two things:

* **Input contract.** Eight fields, time order, closed enums. If a new file
  breaks it, this says so before the error surfaces as an odd number in a
  chart.
* **Published claims.** Every figure the dashboard or the notes put on screen
  is recomputed here by a different path. A claim without a test is a claim
  that expires at the next recalibration.
