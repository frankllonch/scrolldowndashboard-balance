"""
Layer 3: what gets surfaced, when, and what stays quiet.

Three groups of test:

* **Behaviour over the real data.** The claims the dashboard makes on screen
  ("night_drift fires on 19 May", "screen_jump fires on neither profile")
  become assertions here. If a recalibration breaks them, the test says so
  before the reader does.
* **Allocation properties.** Quotas, minimum gaps, cadence.
* **The privacy contract.** No notification names an app or a domain: they
  say what changed, never what you were on. The weekly digest goes further
  and names no category either, so the aggregate stops being an identifier.
