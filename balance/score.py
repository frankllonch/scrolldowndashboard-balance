"""
Layer 2 · a single 0 to 100 number per day.

Five components, each 0 to 100, weighted. The design and its cracks are
explained in the README; the short version:

* **Absolute anchor, personal narrative.** The score is measured against fixed
  bands, not against the user's own past. If it were relative, someone doing a
  constant 6 h/day would score 100 for being constant, and the number would
  stop meaning anything. The comparison against oneself sits *beside* the score
  (`*_delta` in `metrics.py`), not inside it.

* **Blocks do not score.** A BLOCK means the phone did its job: the content
  never opened. Penalising the attempt would punish the user for an impulse the
  product already handled, and would create the wrong incentive (turn the
  protection off to raise your grade). Blocks feed the alert rules and the
  nudge, not the score.

* **The night carries a lot of weight for how little it takes up.** 60 minutes
  of screen at 01:00 does more damage than 60 minutes at 17:00, and it is far
  easier to correct. It is the lever with the best effort-to-benefit ratio.
